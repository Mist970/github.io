      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Commento for a while for comments (without much adoption to be honest), and while I really love the project, and the simplicity of its approach, there&amp;rsquo;s always been one unavoidable thing I never really liked too much: if you want to comment, you have to register to my commento instance.</description>

      <description>As you can see, this website is kinda different. I remade it, just because why not.
I was previously using Hexo with a nice theme called cactus (properly altered to match my preference), but at some point I got tired of that as well.</description>

      <description>This blog is fairly new, and so I still have to set up everything. Comments are obviously a very important part of a blog, especially if you want any kind of feedback on the stuff you&amp;rsquo;re doing.</description>
