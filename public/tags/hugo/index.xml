      <description>As you can see, this website is kinda different. I remade it, just because why not.
I was previously using Hexo with a nice theme called cactus (properly altered to match my preference), but at some point I got tired of that as well.
I wanted to create something simple and straight forward. This is the kind of website without too many bells and whistles. Just a blog, period.
The initial idea of static site generators kinda goes well with this concept, but I don&amp;rsquo;t exactly know when or how things changed.</description>
