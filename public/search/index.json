(i will try my best to describe what had happened as i am still getting used to security onion as of now)\nyou can see a lot of alerts. these alerts are around the time frame of our attack.\nthe first few alerts are in regards to our nmap scan. the alert named \u0026ldquo;gpl dns named version attempt\u0026rdquo; shows that the nmap scan was trying to get information on the version of running services.\nthe alert i want to dive into is \u0026ldquo;gpl attack_response id check returned root\u0026rdquo;. this alert was triggered when we exploited the ftp server and gained root access to the system.\nin the image above, when inspecting this alert further, we see our user input when we gained full access to the system. however, the alert was triggered due to the id command which gave us the following information:\nuid=0(root) gid=0(root)\nhence triggering the alert.\nexploitation: distcc cve-2004-2687 is a vulnerability that allows one to perform remote code execution on servers that have the \u0026ldquo;distributed c compiler\u0026rdquo; deamon running on them.\nwhat is distcc? distcc stands for \u0026quot;distributed c compiler\u0026quot;. it allows programmers to compile code using not only the local machine but also all available servers too. these servers would utilize their unused processing power to help compile to the code too. the compilation takes place through the user's remote commands to the servers. typically, the user would send the source code and the compilation commands to all the available serves to help compile the code ","title":"CTF 1: Metasploitable 2"},{"date":"2023-12-03","image":"/images/Homelab/HTopology.png","imageAlt":"","link":"https://www.haroonakram.co.uk/projects/homelab/","summary":"My Homelab Setup: The topology above is supposed to be my homelab, although my artistic efforts are questionable to say the least, I hope it gives you an idea as to what technologies I\u0026rsquo;ll be dealing with.","tags":["Homelab","Projects"],"text":"my homelab setup: the topology above is supposed to be my homelab, although my artistic efforts are questionable to say the least, i hope it gives you an idea as to what technologies i\u0026rsquo;ll be dealing with. credit goes to marko andrejiÄ‡ , from whom i drew inspiration to build this lab.\nthis homelab is my attempt at various cyber operations like offensive security \u0026amp; dfir.\nmy current cyber security homelab configuration:\ncorporate lan (critical servers):\nactive directory 2019 server + windows hosts metasploitable 2 (represents a vulnerable server in an org) any other vulnerable server would be added into this vlan other servers \u0026amp; databases shall be added in the future corporate wan (fake internet):\nblackarch/kali machine (threat actor\u0026rsquo;s presence within the \u0026ldquo;intranet\u0026rdquo; of an org) dfir \u0026amp; siem:\ntsurugi security onion (mainly sucirata \u0026amp; wazuh for siem as i\u0026rsquo;m still getting used to so) malware analysis:\nremnux flare os the main goal of this homelab is to gain experience in many areas in cyber security like malware analysis, working with a siem, pentesting \u0026amp; general it knowledge of ad to maintain good security practices.\nall my ctf challenges will be done within this homelab environment too.\n","title":"My Homelab"},{"date":"0001-01-01","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://www.haroonakram.co.uk/pages/about/","summary":"Hello World!\nMy name is Haroon Akram, I am recent graduate in the field of Cyber Security.
