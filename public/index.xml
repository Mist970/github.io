<p>Although I have already went over this box in the past, I thought it&rsquo;d be a good start to my CTF series where I&rsquo;ll be doing my best to root a variety of CTFs.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this series is to point out various aspects of systems one can leverage to gain further access into said systems. As well as this, i&rsquo;ll be detailing the purpose of the many hosted services we will see in upcoming CTFs &amp; ways to protect them from attacks too.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="my-homelab-setup">My Homelab Setup:</h2>
<p>The topology above is supposed to be my homelab, although my artistic efforts are questionable to say the least, I hope it gives you an idea as to what technologies I&rsquo;ll be dealing with.</p>
<p>This homelab is my attempt at various cyber operations. I have separated the various areas into VLANs &amp; used PfSense to permit and deny certain areas from communicating to others.</p>
<p><em>My current Cyber Security Homelab configuration:</em></p>
<p>Corporate LAN (Critical servers):</p>
<ul>
<li>Active Directory 2019 Server + Windows Hosts</li>
<li>Metasploitable 2 (Represents a vulnerable server in an org)</li>
<li><em>Any other Vulnerable server would be added into this VLAN</em></li>
<li>Other servers &amp; databases shall be added in the future</li>
</ul>
<p>Corporate WAN (Fake Internet):</p>
<ul>
<li>Blackarch/Kali Machine (Threat actor&rsquo;s presence within the &ldquo;Internet&rdquo; of an org)</li>
</ul>
<p>DFIR &amp; SIEM:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tsurugi</li>
<li>Security Onion (Mainly Wazuh for SIEM as I&rsquo;m still getting used to SO)</li>
</ul>
<p>Malware Analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>REMnux</li>
<li>Flare OS</li>
</ul>
<p>The main goal of this Homelab is to gain experience in many areas in cyber security like malware analysis, working with a SIEM, Pentesting &amp; general IT knowledge of AD to maintain good security practices.</p>
<p>All my CTF challenges will be done within this homelab environment too.</p>
