      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using neovim for a while now, and for me, it&amp;rsquo;s the single best text editor out there.
But it&amp;rsquo;s got a big problem: it&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a hassle, and you have to know what you&amp;rsquo;re doing.</description>

      <description>Between one thing and the other, I found myself in need for a palette manager: something to let me categorize different palettes and easily pick and name colors depending on their use.</description>

      <description>One of the most requested features (and for a good reason) in Feeds has always been ad blocking.
I never came around to implement it, mostly because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a guide or any similar resource, except for GNOME Web&amp;rsquo;s source code, and that&amp;rsquo;s not exactly easy to navigate.</description>

      <description>So, something big is coming for my news reader app Feeds.
Most of this year, as far as personal projects go, I spent at close contact with Gtk4, libadwaita and the awesome people over at the various matrix chat rooms.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Commento for a while for comments (without much adoption to be honest), and while I really love the project, and the simplicity of its approach, there&amp;rsquo;s always been one unavoidable thing I never really liked too much: if you want to comment, you have to register to my commento instance.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m playing around with the new Raspberry Pi Pico, and I quickly realized that I&amp;rsquo;d really love to have a quick pinout reference in my terminal.
I thought of making a man page, but I would have lost the color (I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to use arbitrary colors in groff), so I just created a simple text file with ascii escape sequences for colors and called it a day.</description>

      <description>I learned most of this stuff from this awesome series of articles by Larry Price. Give it a read, it&amp;rsquo;s worth it.
Why D-Bus daemons are quite useful tools. What would you need them for?</description>

      <description>I am a quite avid reddit user. Like it or not, reddit is a very central place where communities for stuff that I care about tend to aggregate.
For the longest time, I have felt the need for a reddit app on my Linux desktop, and I waited and kept waiting for one that would finally allow me to break free of using the web version.</description>

      <description>The back and forward buttons on your mouse are incredibly useful, at least for me. I use them all the time!
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a proper way to map it on my app until I asked on the GTK Matrix chatroom, there baedert sent me a couple of links to how he did it in his app corebird.</description>

      <description>One of the most common things you might wanna do with images, that is making them automatically resize to adapt to the available space they have, is not possible with Gtk.</description>

      <description>Man pages are awesome. They genuinely are. In any *nix system you can just get documentation on your programs or even some programming things (namely a lot of C stuff, this was very useful in University) offline by just using a tiny simple command.</description>

      <description>As you can see, this website is kinda different. I remade it, just because why not.
I was previously using Hexo with a nice theme called cactus (properly altered to match my preference), but at some point I got tired of that as well.</description>

      <description>Alright, I started writing some unit tests for Feeds and I wanted to integrate them into meson, so that I can just run meson test or ninja test during build and have them run automagically.</description>

      <guid>/posts/feeds-moved-to-world-and-design-overhaul/</guid>
      <description>It finally happened, Feeds is now part of the World group! Here&amp;rsquo;s the new repository! But don&amp;rsquo;t worry, I&amp;rsquo;ll keep up with the existing GitLab mirror.
This doesn&amp;rsquo;t change too much in terms of development, but it surely makes the app more discoverable.</description>

      <title>Feeds 0.8: naming change and how to deal with Flatpak</title>
      <link>/posts/feeds-0-8-naming-change-and-how-to-deal-with-flatpak/</link>

      <guid>/posts/feeds-0-8-naming-change-and-how-to-deal-with-flatpak/</guid>
      <description>Feeds version 0.8 is coming. This release have been a little overdue, since I finally decided to change the name of the app from gnome-feeds to just gfeeds. This has to do with the use of the GNOME name, and besides even GNOME apps don&amp;rsquo;t use the GNOME prefix in their names.</description>

      <description>Thanks to this document, and a quick look at nautilus&amp;rsquo;s git repo I was able to automatically generate fresh flatpaks directly from GitLab by using the integrated CI/CD system.
My current setup isn&amp;rsquo;t perfect but it manages to automate flatpak builds.</description>

      <description>So I recently got myself a shiny new AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT GPU (that&amp;rsquo;s a mouthful).
Let&amp;rsquo;s see how it does on Linux.
Installation First, I use Arch (btw) and that makes things a lot easier, at least for now.</description>

      <description>Feeds version 0.7 should be out soon with all the features detailed in this post.
The code starts to feel a little more complex, and it would probably use another small refactoring, but that&amp;rsquo;s not too important right now.</description>

      <description>Recap In a previous post I layed out a roadmap for my feed reader application Feeds. Here&amp;rsquo;s a little update on how things are going.
Alright, first I want to thank @Etamuk again.</description>

      <description>My new web home Hey people. I finally got around at creating a static blog.
After using Hugo for a while, and initially deciding to try out Pelican, just to realize it&amp;rsquo;s in a sad, outdated state right now, I settled on Hexo.</description>
