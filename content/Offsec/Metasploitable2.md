Although I have already went over this box in the past, I thought it'd be a good start to my CTF series where I'll be doing my best to root a variety of CTFs. 

The main purpose of this series is to point out various aspects of systems one can leverage to gain further access into said systems. As well as this, i'll be detailing the purpose of the many hosted services we will see in upcoming CTFs & ways to protect them from attacks too.

I hope you enjoy!
