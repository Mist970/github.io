Hello World! 

My name is Haroon Akram, I am recent graduate in the field of **Cyber Security**.
I am looking for an opportunity to showcase my knowledge in a practical environment & contribute towards the IT industry. 

I have knowledge pertaining towards topics found in the following certificates:
- A+ 
- Network+
- Security+
- CCNA 

However, I'll be presenting my practical experience/knowledge closely related to cyber security on this website! 

I'll be using this blog to discuss whatever I find interesting (Mostly Tech, Cyber-related stuff & whatever else).

Oh...and I like practicing Calisthenics too :)
# Contacts
You can find me on LinkedIn (for now). I'm always up for a good chat about anything! :)
