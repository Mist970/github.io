Hello World! 

My name is Haroon Akram, I am recent graduate in the field of **Cyber Security**.

I have knowledge pertaining to the following certificates:
- A+ 
- Network+

- CCNA 

However, I will be presenting my practical experience/knowledge on this website! 

I'll be using this blog to discuss whatever I find interesting (Mostly Tech, Cyber-related stuff & whatever else).
